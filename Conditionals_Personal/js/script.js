//Planning a vacation want to see if we have enough money to go Disney World or Disney Land

var vacationBudget = 5000;
var disneyWorld = 4987;

//going to do the equation to see if it works

if(disneyWorld > vacationBudget){
	console.log("Then we will go to Disney Land!!")
}else{
	console.log("We will be headed to Disney World!!")
}

//change price of Disney World to offset to see if it works
